# Day 001 â€“ [Project Name]

## What I Built
_Made a band name generator which just took the city you grew up in and pet's name and combined them_

## What I Learned
- \n is for new line
- print("Hello " + input("What's your name?")) - this starts with input then prints afterwards

## Hardest Part
_Nothing challenging today_

## Extra Challenges or Features
_N/A_

## Reflection
_Simple refresher_
