# Day 002 – [Project Name]

## What I Built
Followed along with the course and completed the Day 2 project.

## What I Learned
- Repetition of basic concepts from Day 1
- Practiced using [mention any modules/concepts used: e.g., input(), print(), f-strings]

## Hardest Part
Nothing too difficult today — it was more about reviewing and reinforcing.

## Extra Challenges or Features
None added today — just followed along.

## Reflection
Didn't learn too much new, but still valuable to stay consistent and build the daily habit.
