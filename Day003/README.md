# Day 003 – Treasure Island Adventure Game

## What I Built
A simple **text-based adventure game** where the user navigates a series of choices to find a hidden treasure.  
The game uses conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to branch story outcomes based on player input.

## What I Learned
- How to chain multiple input prompts and use `if`/`else` to create a story flow
- Using `.lower()` to handle case-insensitive input from users
- Escaping quotes in strings using `\'`
- Formatting multi-line strings and prompts with `\n`

## Hardest Part
Nothing too difficult today — mostly reviewing how to nest conditions and structure multiple decision paths.

## Extra Challenges or Features
- Personalized responses and outcomes
- Fun messages depending on choices
- Included ASCII art for atmosphere

## Reflection
It felt good to build something fun and interactive.  
While it was relatively easy, it helped reinforce how user input and conditionals can be combined to build more engaging programs.  
Looking forward to adding more features or surprises in future versions!
